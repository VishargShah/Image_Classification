Classify the image is of dog or cat using Convolutional Neural Network

Dataset consist of 10000 images from which 5000 was of dog and 5000 of cat.
4000 from each was used for training purpose and 1000 for testing.

Used 2 convolution layer with batch size of 32 and filter of 3*3.
Used MaxPooling with pool matrix of 2*2.

Got the accuracy of around 85%.
